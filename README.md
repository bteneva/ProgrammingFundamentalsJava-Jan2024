Welcome to my repository containing solutions for the exercises in the Java Fundamentals programming course at SoftUni. 
These solutions were crafted during my journey of learning to code in Java. While they represent my understanding at the time, 
I acknowledge that there might be better or more efficient variants.

Feel free to explore the solutions, and if you have any suggestions, improvements, or would like to discuss alternative approaches,
I'm open to collaboration. Let's learn and grow together!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
